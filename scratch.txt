look up later:
	random docs do not mention the constructor
	why can I assign to false?
	how many cards do players start with?

Thoughts
	- Referee knows about user actions.  GameState does not.
	- Referee doesn't want to know much about GameState internals.
		  It wants to call something like "next_characters_turn"
		  instead of setting properites on gamestate fields directly.

	- Conundrum - do I used indexes or id's to refer to items in general.


    - Would be nice if Referee didn't have any state to be saved between actions.s

    - should Referee and Gamestate be combined?

Refactor:
	- canonicalize district/building and person/character
	- PEP8 adherence - get rid of camelcase
